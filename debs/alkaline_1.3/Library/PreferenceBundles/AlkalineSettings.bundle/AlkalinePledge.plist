			<string>You didn't have to click this, but you did, and for that I thank you. My intent here is not to be a downer, but to bring attention to a cause that is close to my heart: Neuroblastoma.</string>

			<string>What is Neuroblastoma?</string>
			<key>footerText</key>
			<string>Neuroblastoma is a form of cancer that starts in certain types of very early forms of nerve cells found in an embryo or fetus. This type of cancer occurs in infants and young children. It is rarely found in children older than 10 years.</string>

			<string>Did you know that of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) $4.6 billion federal budget, only 3% goes to pediatric cancer research? By comparison, breast cancer receives 12% and prostate cancer receives 7%. Oh, and that 3%.. that's COMBINED, across ALL pediatric cancers (for the record, there's 12)! The American Cancer Society spends less than $0.70 for each $100 raised on childhood cancer.</string>

			<key>footerText</key>
			<string>No problem! You can still help by spreading word about Neuroblastoma to friends and family. Many young children go undiagnosed in the earlier (more treatable) stages due to lack of awareness. The more who know, the better the chances of early detection and treatment.</string>
