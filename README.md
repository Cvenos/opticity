# Opticity Repository

![Opticity Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cvenos/opticity/master/CydiaIcon.png)

Opticity is a simple repo that has obviously Cydia/Sileo tweaks on it. I want to have tweaks compatible with the latest jailbreak like checkra1n or unc0ver. If there are any developers out there seeing this, I would be more than happy to put your tweaks on here for completely free!
