Opticity is a simple repo that has obviously Cydia/Sileo tweaks on it. I try to have only iOS 12 Jailbrek by [pwn20wnd](https://twitter.com/Pwn20wnd). You can also always [contact me](https://twitter.com/opticranger2702) if you think a tweak should be removed or have any suggestions for tweaks to add. If there are any developers out there seeing this, I would be more than happy to put your tweaks on here for completely free! There maybe be may some pirated tweaks on this repo depending on demand for them.
